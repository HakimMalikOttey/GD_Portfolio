                        <p>Current Location: Queens, New York</p>
                        <p>Throughout my college career, I desired to assist any student to the best of my ability. To
                            achieve this, I
                            entered the Student Ambassador position and assisted numerous prospective and current
                            students
                            in
                            understanding
                            some aspects of their degrees. I also helped guide some students who struggled with their
                            classes, while
                            also
                            giving them advice on how they could improve on their methods. I also guided many of my
                            fellow
                            teammates in
                            understanding all tasks that they need to complete, while also filling in for them in places
                            where they
                            struggled.</p>


                        <p>As a student ambassador, I greeted students who were interested in the University of
                            Advancing
                            Technology,
                            giving them tours of the campus to showcase the projects, facilities, and events that the
                            school
                            had to
                            offer. I
                            gave many of the students my outlook on the college, telling students who want to enter my
                            degree about some
                            of
                            the projects that I worked on and how they could handle their projects. I wished to give
                            students an
                            interesting
                            look into how their time at the school would play out. I have also created numerous blogs
                            within
                            my position
                            that was meant to guide other students interested in Game Design and Programming – giving
                            them
                            tools and
                            tips
                            about Game Design theory, creating games within Game Jams, and ways to design levels/maps.
                        </p>


                        <p>While just being a student, though, I still interacted with some of the student body – giving
                            a
                            few students
                            some feedback on their work, while also helping them out with some of the programming issues
                            that they had.
                            I
                            helped playtests a lot of the games that were made by fellow students within the
                            universities
                            Production
                            Studio,
                            while also learning from the input they gave when they playtested a game that I worked on
                            with
                            other
                            online/offline students– Project Techno. With that said, I also contributed to that team by
                            filling in for
                            the
                            lead and fixing a lot of the bugs that were present within the game. Lastly, I have acted as
                            the
                            programmer
                            and
                            scrum master for the team that created SpiderBot, guiding fellow programmers in creating and
                            optimizing the
                            AI
                            and contour recognition for the project.</p>


                        <p>From my experiences with interacting with the student body and the games that the game
                            development students
                            created, I desired to create a community where independent game developers could give each
                            other
                            advice,
                            start
                            development of a game and get support from other independent developers, and release games
                            under
                            a single
                            company name. I want to be able to help multiple developers with documentation and creating
                            a
                            plan for their
                            development cycle but to also use my knowledge in 2D and 3D art, Unity, and Unreal to assist
                            these teams in
                            areas that they are struggling to fill. I am currently achieving a portion of this by
                            assisting
                            a game
                            development team that is stationed in Ontario, Canada as a programmer for their latest game
                            in
                            development,
                            giving them guidance in creating their design documents and how we should approach creating
                            the
                            tasks for
                            music
                            development and map development for the game.</p>
